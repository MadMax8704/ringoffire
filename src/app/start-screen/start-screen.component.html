            It's a classic at basically every pre-drinks,
            Freshers event and house party ever,
            Ring of Fire is a guaranteed crowd pleaser.
            Plus, unlike games such as beer pong,
            there's little equipment or prep needed.
            Simply open the App on your phone or PC, start a game and share the URL with the other players, 
            a huge pint glass and a group of willing participant and voil√†. The game is
            also known as King's Cup, Circle of Death (lovely!) and Doughnut.</p>
